My name is Lukáš Kubík, I am a researcher of Asia, historian and koreanist. I am also a board member of the [Czech Association of Orientalists](http://orientalistickyexpres.cz) (Orientalistický expres) and street photographer. 

"Doctoral student"

Currently I am studying a Ph. D. programme History and Cultures of Asian and African Countries at the Institute of Asian Studies, Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague. I am interested in the diplomatic relations the medieval East Asia, especially Korea and China. Moreover I am interested in the medieval maritime piracy.

"Streetphotography"

I started to be interested in photography back in 2014 when I was visiting Korea for the first time as an exchange student. Soon after I realized I was more interested in capturing the mood society I was in than in selfies. However, it was in 2016 in Hong Kong when really started into street photography. It was my Chinese roomate with Leica at horrible backpacker's hostel at Wan Chain who showed my how to compose and how to approach strangers. 
I should say that my work is definitely influnced by japanese school of street photography by artists such as Daido Moriyama, Nobuyoshi Araki, Tatsuo Suzuki and others. I should also name Josef Koudelka. Moreover, I always find inspiration in cinematography of  Wong Kar-wai or Diao Yinan whose visual style mesmerizes me. 

In my photos I am trying to visualy capture and describe moods and feelings of the city. I shoot mostly in black and white photos (but occasionaly in color).
