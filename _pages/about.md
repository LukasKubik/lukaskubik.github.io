Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is <b>Lukáš Kubík</b>. I am a historian with a Master's degree in Korean Studies from Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at the same institution.

My academic interests encompass a wide range of topics, including premodern East Asian history, the history of Korea, and the Cold War. My doctoral research project dives into the fascinating world of medieval maritime piracy and international relations during the late Koryo period.
As an active member of the CSSR-Korea project, I explore the complex political history and diplomatic exchanges between the DPRK, CSSR, and third-world countries, seeking to illuminate new perspectives on these vital historical relationships.

This website is my online academic curriculum vitae and a platform for sharing my field research experiences and travelogues.
