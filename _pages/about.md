My name is <b>Lukáš Kubík</b>. I am a Ph. D. student of the programme History and Cultures of Asian and African Countries at the Institute of Asian Studies, Faculty of Arts, <b>Charles University in Prague</b>. I am interested in the history of premodern East Asia, international relations, and maritime piracy. My dissertational project deals with Korean history and medieval maritime piracy at the end of the 14th century from an international relations perspective. The project aims to explain the role of Japanese pirates in Koryŏ’s internal politics during the reign of King Kongmin and interpret their activities and impacts into a broader context of historical events.
