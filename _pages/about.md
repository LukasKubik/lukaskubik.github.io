My name is <b>Lukáš Kubík</b>, I am a koreanist, historian and researcher of Asia. I am a board member of the [Czech Association of Orientalists](http://orientalistickyexpres.cz) (Orientalistický expres) and also a street photographer from <b>Prague, Czech Republic</b>. 

<b>Doctoral student</b>

Currently, I am studying a Ph. D. program History and Cultures of Asian and African Countries at the Institute of Asian Studies, Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague. I am interested in the diplomatic relations of medieval East Asia, especially Korea and China. Moreover, I am interested in medieval maritime piracy.

<b>Streetphotography</b>

I started to be interested in photography back in 2014 when I visited Korea for the first time as an exchange student. Soon after, I realized I was more interested in capturing the mood of society than I was in selfies. However, it was in 2016 in Hong Kong when I really started into street photography. It was my Chinese roommate with Leica at a horrible backpacker's hostel at Wan Chain who showed me how to compose, and how to approach strangers.

I should say that my work is definitely influenced by Japanese school of street photography and artists such as Daido Moriyama, Nobuyoshi Araki, Tatsuo Suzuki, and others. I should also name Josef Koudelka. Moreover, I always find inspiration in the cinematography of Wong Kar-wai or Diao Yinan whose visual style mesmerizes me.

I shoot mostly in black and white (occasionaly in color). If you are interested in my photography, follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sifonkubik/) or follow the hashtag [#praguecameraclub](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/praguecameraclub/).
