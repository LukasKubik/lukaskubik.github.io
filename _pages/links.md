The Comprehensive Mirror (in Czech "V≈°eobecn√© zrdcadlo digit√°ln√≠ Asie") is an online catalogue of Digital Humanities resources and tools for Asian studies built on the bookmark manager [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io). It was made together with [Martin Hanker](https://martin-hanker.netlify.app) as an research guide mainly for Czech students and researchers of Asia. As of now it contains more than 270 bookmarks related to China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, India, Tibet, Indonesia and Vietnam (following the departments at the [Institute of Asian Studies](https://uas.ff.cuni.cz/en/departments/) and the [Department of Sinology](https://ksi.ff.cuni.cz/en/homepage/) at the Charles University).

For use, click on more and the window with the platform will pop up. Clicking on the search symbol will show you thematic and regional hashtags. For example, if you are interested in digital
tools for sinology, click on "#üåè China". You can further specify your selection using additional #hashtags.
